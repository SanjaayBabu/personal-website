f:T48f8,<p>The class compelled me to question assumptions I had about justice and what it took to build a just world. Below is a reflective essay I wrote to round out my class. But it’s only one of what I hope will be a two part essay, with the second being a reflection on what it takes to achieve the kind of justice I propose at the end of this essay.
</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=restorative-justice-1&#x26;img=images%2Fallyourfaces.jpg" alt="allyourfaces"></p>
<p>“We’ve discussed some of the problems with criminal justice in this class. How does restorative justice fix these problems?” I was never really satisfied with this question whenever it came up during show and tell. It’s true that criminal justice needs reform in the US – incarceration rates are high, crime remains high, and racial minorities are disproportionately represented in carceral institutions. On the other hand, punitive justice in Singapore appears effective, suggesting that punitive justice is not inherently flawed. Why can’t the US just build a better punitive justice system? Why does the US need something radically different, when punitive justice has the potential to work? Perhaps my biggest intellectual transformation in this class was questioning what it really means for a justice system to “work.” While my initial view was primarily utilitarian (i.e. minimizing crime rates), this class led me to a broader view of justice that also promotes moral deliberation and healing. Given restorative justice’s effectiveness at achieving these two further aims, restorative justice (RJ) should accompany punitive justice in a hybrid system.</p>
<p><strong>Justice beyond Consequentialism</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of this semester, I began to see the shortcomings of my utilitarian perspective on justice. Prior to this class, I felt that the primary measure of quality for a justice system was how good it was at minimizing crime.</p>
<p>Two problems arise when we equate justice with low crime rates. First, crime surely isn’t the only form of injustice in the world. In Chapter 6 of The Little Book of Race and Restorative Justice, Fania Davis highlighted the various manifestations of structural injustice that African Americans in the United States face, offering just one example of how injustice exists outside of crime. Implying that a low-crime society is a just one leads us to ignore these various other forms of injustice, making my initial view narrow. To be clear, I still believe that minimizing crime is important. The pursuit of minimizing crime can nudge public institutions to address underlying causes of crime which themselves are other forms of injustice – such as poverty and employment discrimination. However, forms of injustice will remain even when crime is low, and therefore, our fight for a more just world should not stop at keeping crime minimal.</p>
<p>A second problem with the utilitarian view is that it could disregard human dignity in the pursuit of keeping crime low. Simplistically viewing justice as an optimization problem of minimizing crime would often lead us too far, even to the end of disregarding human dignity. Sandel would concur with my criticism of utilitarianism’s overreach; he argued that consequentialism leaves human rights contingent on utility, rather than viewing them as inherently important (37).</p>
<p>Given these two limitations, I realized that the utilitarian aim of minimizing crime is an insufficient roadmap for building a just society. I needed a broader view of what justice requires.</p>
<p><strong>Moral deliberation</strong></p>
<p>In our pursuit of a just society, we must first come together and figure out what a just society looks like. To do so, we should be comfortable discussing, “challenging, contesting, … listening to, and learning” one another’s moral convictions, and build a society that embodies these values. In Sandel’s words, we should engage in public “moral deliberation” (268).</p>
<p>Why is this critical? Public moral deliberation enables us to build more just social institutions. If institutions inevitably advance some conception of morality or another, as Sandel argues (253), then we are better off if all citizens, rather than just the powerful elite, decide what virtues should guide our institutions. Iran – a country I spent this semester delving deep into for another class – offers a negative example of how societies become unjust in the absence of open moral deliberation. In September 2022, Iran’s “morality police” arrested and beat the 23-year-old Mahsa Amini to death for not wearing her hijab (veil) properly. Throngs of Iranians took to the streets protesting such injustice, because most of the population did not see wearing the hijab as a moral duty. If the Iranian regime had allowed collective deliberation on the moral status of the veil, they might have built institutions that respected, rather than violated, their citizen’s values – institutions far different from the “morality police”. A successful politics of moral deliberation can help us create public institutions represent our moral beliefs, making our societies more just.</p>
<p>Restorative practices are helpful in facilitating this moral deliberation because of their emphasis on storytelling and their flexible process. The “choose your own adventure” sustained dialogue circle we conducted in class, regarding sexual harassment in schools, offers a vivid illustration of these two facets of RP.</p>
<p>Firstly, the circle promoted storytelling. Stories are critical in our moral lives: according to Alasdair MacIntyre, we form our moral views based on the narratives we find ourselves part of (Sandel 224). If MacIntyre is right, then the best way for us to have a conversation about morals is for us to collectively share and discuss the stories that our morals are based on. In our class Circle, prompts were specifically tailored to encourage participants to share their stories. One example of such a prompt invited us to share a story of a time we learnt about the red lines in romantic relationships. By sharing our story and listening to others’ stories, we understood how each of us arrived at our beliefs on red lines. Consequently, we had a harmonious, constructive conversation on how to collectively respond to sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Besides prompting storytelling, Circles is also a flexible process. Restorative practices lend communities, rather than facilitators, the power to steer the conversation in the direction they want to go. RJ formats and pre-prepared questions are meant to be a “compass, not a map” to justice (Zehr 10) with broad principles rather than specific prescriptions. Such flexibility makes collective deliberation more authentic. For instance, when our Circle group discussed the questions on the report prepared by the Victoria University in Wellington, our conversation was stale – some of the questions simply felt irrelevant. Sensing that our group wanted to talk about a more immediate problem – our fears of increased sexual harassment in the Greek life rush period – our Keepers changed course. As a result, our conversation turned much more concrete, lively, and meaningful.</p>
<p>In summary, restorative practices are an effective method of prompting the collective moral deliberation that I see as a critical facet of a just world.</p>
<p><strong>Justice and healing</strong></p>
<p>Lower crime rates and moral deliberation aside, we ought to build better immediate responses to harm, to allow victims to heal. While preventing future crime and building just institutions prevents harm, Brookes argued that the question remains: “What do we do now that harm has already been caused?” (3). Zehr (10) argued that promoting victims’ healing is the right thing to do. His argument is interesting, but he doesn’t explain why healing is the right thing to do. But I agree, and I will attempt to justify Zehr’s argument.</p>
<p>Helping victims heal is the right thing to do because of our “obligations of solidarity” towards those who suffer. When crime happens, victims are not the only ones who suffer. In a sense, an entire community suffers, because a norm was violated. If moral obligations sometimes stem from membership of communities (Sandel 224), then societies have an “obligation of solidarity” to help victims heal. In fact, this obligation is instinctual; we go out of our way to help those we love to heal from harm they experience. Picture a child who trips on a rock, falls, and is now bleeding. What will we do? Will we simply move the rock and prevent others from doing the same? Likely not. We would also probably gingerly bandage the child’s wound, and assure them that everything will be alright. If helping others heal is instinctual, then why do we neglect healing in a societal context, and instead focus on dispassionate expediency in the justice system?</p>
<p>But to be honest, the real catalyst for my focus on healing wasn’t this philosophical argument. Instead, it was because I developed a greater sense of empathy for victims of crime through this course. Generally, we have no trouble seeing the pain that victims face when crime happens to them; in fact, victims’ pain is often spectacularized to help prosecutors win trials. However, we do not see the pain they go through during and after the trial. Chanel Miller’s emotional victim impact statement depicts this pain powerfully. Miller’s pain did not magically end after the trial. Instead, the trial traumatized her even more — gaps in her evidence were weaponized by opposing counsel to undermine her credibility, and the defendant deflected blame towards her rather than taking responsibility. Ultimately, Miller’s pain persisted for years, even after the judge banged the gavel and, to (ironically) use a common legal aphorism, justice was served. Evidently, our present conception of justice neglects victims’ healing. My empathy for victims’ prolonged pain led me to see healing as a goal worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Restorative processes offer a guide to start the healing process. Healing is intentional in RJ. According to Zehr (14-15), RJ was designed specifically to center justice around giving victims the things they need to heal: information, truth-telling, empowerment, and restitution. The movie All Your Faces illustrates how pre-conferences and facilitated dialogues meet these four needs and therefore facilitate healing. Chloé Delarme struggled for years with the trauma of being abused as a child by her brother Benjamin. In pre-conferencing, the restorative justice facilitator Judith prompted Chloé to think of the questions to which she needed answers. During the conference, Chloé received most of the answers she wanted to hear. Throughout the process, Chloé was empowered — she was allowed to shape the process based on what she needed. Finally, even though the RJ process didn’t end with a formal apology, it succeeded at promoting Chloé’s healing. In her final analysis, Chloé claimed the encounter helped her move on from “grief, and immense anger… [and] hatred”. Chloé’s story reveals how restorative practices are a useful process by which we can achieve our aim of healing. Restorative practices translate human empathy into action – into compassion.</p>
<p><strong>A hybrid justice system</strong></p>
<p>As I’ve illustrated throughout this essay, my views on what it takes to build a just world have broadened significantly. I see my three aims for justice – low crime, moral deliberation, and healing – as compatible. With that, I believe in a hybrid justice process where punitive justice and restorative practices go hand in hand to achieve these three ideals.</p>
<p>Punitive justice and restorative justice serve different purposes; and they are not mutually exclusive. Zehr acknowledges this claim, arguing that restorative justice is not meant to replace punitive justice, at least in the short run. Instead, it balances the current legal system’s excessive focus on the “public dimension” of crime, rather than the “private dimension” of harm (12). Therefore, it is theoretically possible to blend punitive and restorative justice. In fact, such a hybrid system might be desirable: practitioners of RJ in transitional justice contexts suggested that a hybrid system is most effective (ICTJ footnote 49). Perhaps, I argued in my second essay, a hybrid approach is the best solution to prevent RJ from being misused to couch impunity under the veneer of reconciliation, while enabling societies to reap the various fruits of a restorative system.</p>
<p>But do we even need a punitive system to keep crime low? Why can’t norms replace laws as a mechanism to prevent crime? I view the punitive justice system as an “insurance policy”. If nothing else stops someone from causing harm — not norms, not respect for human dignity — then perhaps clear knowledge of what the consequences will stop them. This mechanism was intentionally conceived. Foucault argued that we began to neatly map crimes to punishments so that people would know what exactly would happen to them if they committed a crime (95-97). The consequences of crime become predictable and consistent, and therefore potential criminals will account for these consequences when deciding whether to commit crime.</p>
<p>In an early reflection, a classmate questioned whether this mechanism actually works, pointing to continued high crime in the US despite a punitive system. I have two responses. First, socioeconomic factors undermine deterrence. If extreme destitution makes the benefits of crime outweigh the costs – even when including punishment – crime will persist. Secondly, enforcement capabilities matter. The threat of punishment holds no water if it’s unlikely to happen. In Singapore’s case, strong enforcement is probably as important to safety as strict laws. All in all, I am still convinced that punitive systems have a deterrent effect that will work when all else fails – an “insurance policy.” For this reason, I continue to support parallel existence of a punitive justice system alongside our use of restorative practices.</p>
<p>Moving from theory to practice, is it possible for governments to systematize RJ alongside punitive justice? In her essay Beyond Restorative Justice: Radical Organizing Against Women, Andrea Smith offers a harsh critique of government-led restorative processes. Smith claims the government cannot ethically lead restorative processes for domestic violence because government is partly responsible for the violence (257). Smith’s argument triggers a bigger question on whether governments can be involved in restorative processes when they share some blame.</p>
<p>I personally think government has the potential to do great good. If the government, this Leviathan, can inflict tremendous amounts of harm, then it can also do great good. My view is particularly true in democracies. Democratic governments are imperfect, but they are ours, and we can use them as a vehicle to build the communities we want to create. An inspiring example of how governmental authority and resources can create great good came to me in my interview with Mr. Mohammad Julkipli, the Attorney-General of the Philippines’ Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (BARMM). The BARMM incentivized and provided logistical and technical support for Katarungang Pambarangay (village justice). Through the government’s partnerships with local actors, RJ has become a viable, trusted form of justice in Bangsamoro.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Just work for everyone</strong></p>
<p>Justice requires more than low crime rates – it also requires moral deliberation and healing. My essay defended a hybrid justice system; but perhaps there remains a final remaining question: where do we fit in? Towards the end of the course, I experienced an empowering epiphany. What if justice isn’t only the work of justice systems and institutions? What if every one of us is an agent of justice? In fact, my thought wasn’t actually an epiphany – it was a rediscovery. In my very first reflection, I talked about how everyone has a role in the justice system. Perhaps that statement needs revising. Everyone has a role in building a just world. Moral deliberation and healing, as I argued, isn’t work that only elites or “trained professionals” should do – that work is for everyone. If we all step in, rather than stand by, we can have hope for a just world. To build a just world, we don’t need magic. We need just work.</p>
<p>My work starts now. I have an idea to start facilitating preventive circles within my community in Singapore at a grassroots level, in order to build a stronger community and deal with neighborhood issues. This project should be an interesting start; we’ll see where it leads me!</p>

10:T2cbf,<p>Gorgias explores rhetoric, power, and pathways to the good life. In this reflection, I will examine Socrates’ view of (a) rhetoric, its power and the need for it to be moderated, (b) the disjunct between appearance and reality on questions of pleasure, pain, good and bad, and (c) the need for philosophy and contemplation to live the good life.</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=reflecting-on-gorgias&#x26;img=images%2Fgorgias.jpg" alt="Gorgias"></p>
<p><strong>The power of rhetoric</strong></p>
<p>First, Gorgias establishes that rhetoricians are influential. Socrates does not contest that in his context, rhetoricians are influential (“[rhetoric] manifestly appears to me as a power demonic in greatness”). (emphasis added) He sees rhetoric’s power to spur action, from how he concedes that indeed, great rhetoricians’ counsel inspired the building of dockyards, harbours and city walls.</p>
<p><strong>Ambivalent power</strong></p>
<p>However, Socrates establishes how rhetoric’s power does not always serve good causes. This is because the skill of persuasion, in itself, is not grounded in any fundamental truths or morality. Rhetoricians’ public speech can destabilise truth and authorities of truth. For example, should a rhetorician and a doctor “have to contest in speech… which of the two ought to be chosen doctor”, it would be the rhetorician — “the man with the power to speak” — that an uninformed audience would choose. Gorgias concedes that with the “great” power of rhetoric, rhetoricians ought to “​​use rhetoric, Socrates, just as every other competitive skill” including “boxing and pankration and fighting in heavy armour”, because of its harm it might cause. With this, we cannot take the assumption that all rhetoricians are well-intentioned and knowledgeable in matters of justice — “of necessity know[ing] the just and unjust things, either beforehand or by learning them later from [Gorgias]”. Gorgias himself acknowledges the harm that might arise.</p>
<p>Socrates also empirically establishes how ineffective public rhetoric has been at promoting good virtue in citizens. Instead, it solely speaks to people’s desires without accounting for what is fundamentally good to them. This parallels how cookery satisfies people’s desires while medicine examines what is good for someone. To Socrates, rhetoric flatters (“supplying the city with the things it desired”) but does not succeed at “leading [people’s] desires in a different direction” and “persuading and forcing [citizens] toward the condition in which the citizens were to be better” — which is the ultimate goal of a polis in Ancient Greece. To the contrary, rhetoricians, including Pericles, seem to have made their audiences “more savage”, and therefore “more unjust and worse”.</p>
<p>Contemporary examples show that not all persuasive individuals use their persuasion to advance the truth, or promote goodness. Half-truths, such as President Bill Clinton’s misleading cover-up of his sexual harassment case, are increasingly common. More concerningly, inflammatory speech and actions appealing to people’s emotions, such as that used by Alternative für Deutschland in Germany, is harmful.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with the harms of rhetoric</strong></p>
<p>Who has the duty to ensure that misleading speech does not cause harm? Is it the speaker, or the listener? I believe that Socrates passingly addresses this. In drawing the distinction between inspiring knowledge and inspiring belief, Socrates acknowledges that the orator “would not be able… to teach so large a mob such great matters in a short time”. Arguably, Socrates is cognizant that audiences might not be able to grasp the whole truth. Indeed, today, we rely on experts to fill in knowledge gaps, and many of us take their word to be true. During the COVID pandemic, we trusted that epidemiologists know what they do. This further contextualized why Fish, Stanley and Simpson argued for no platforming — given universities’ pursuit to advance truth and confidence in the truth, any speech from such persuasive orators which harms trust in universities and their academic process should be restricted.</p>
<p>My issue with this argument, though, is that the same principle could be applied to the rest of society as well — and I think Socrates too makes the case for general restrictions to free speech, not just in specific settings.</p>
<p>All this is to say, perhaps Socrates would be sympathetic towards restrictions on harmful free speech, simply because he does not have full faith in there being a discerning audience that can parse speech and find the truth, nor does he have full faith in public rhetoricians to nurture good.</p>
<p><strong>Power - what does it mean? Is freedom power?</strong></p>
<p>Shifting from the societal effects of rhetoricians’ power to how this power affects rhetoricians (and all powerful people), Socrates first examines means to be powerful. Polus argues that power is having options — in his case, orators are powerful because they may “kill whomever they wish, and confiscate possessions, and expel from the cities whomever it seems good to them”. There are few restrictions to a powerful person’s freedom.</p>
<p>With that said, Socrates contends that for someone intending to live the much-desired good life, unfettered freedom is not the way to go. In his argument, I interpreted the concept of the distinction between the higher good as rising above base desires.</p>
<p>Socrates makes an interesting semantic distinction, between what one “wish[es]”, and what “seems to them to be best”. I thought the word “wish” was interesting — it reveals a sense of aspiration, something elevated. “Seems”, on the other hand, is surface level. It is confined to the realm of appearances. Perhaps this understanding is not unique to Socrates. Polus too acknowledges this, having conceded that the man who does something that seems good but is indeed bad “does not seem… to do what he wishes”.</p>
<p>Shifting from the semantic to the philosophical, Socrates makes arguments distinguishing the base and the noble throughout this text. For example, Socrates proves that even though punishment might be painful, this is still abstractly good (possibly, good for the soul). This is most powerfully conveyed by the inversion of the word “wretched”. There are two meanings that this word carries, one belonging to Polus and one belonging to Socrates. In 469a, “wretched” is defined by Socrates as a spiritual degradation, in response to acting unjustly. When Polus uses the same word in 472e, to define how one would feel if punished, Socrates is quick to refute it — to Socrates punishment is a form of redemption, painful on the surface but healing within. What is the implication of this? Freedom should be exercised with the necessary discernment. Such discernment enables one to determine what is truly good, versus what appeals to our desires but might not be good.</p>
<p><strong>Contemplation to achieve the good life</strong></p>
<p>How may one get better at discernment? I would argue that Socrates has a clear answer: knowledge and philosophy. In the text, it is acknowledged by both Polus and Socrates that “doing what seems good without intelligence is a bad thing”. Knowledge promotes discernment needed to prevent one from using their power to their own detriment, doing “unjust and based things”. In the example we discussed in class regarding our professor’ son and his desire for a baseball bat, I perceived this as a case of falsely valuing the baseball bat. In the absence of knowledge, we falsely value the item. Even amongst highly educated people, such cognitive distortions are common. The most prominent example is how we often weigh immediate pleasures more than future pleasures — this is why we find it easier to have those extra one or two donuts.</p>
<p>Knowledge also prevents the excess of ambition, temptation and desire that “thoughtless”, “uninitiated” (493b) might face. Instead, they may enjoy an “orderly” life (493d). This word carries some additional meaning given the Greeks, famously Aristotle, believed in a natural order. If order in a civil society is a dream worth aspiring to, knowledge is the way to get there, according to Socrates.</p>
<p>Is true knowledge possible? According to an article by Julian Dutra published by the University of Chicago’s Center for Practical wisdom, Socrates argued that perfect, all-encompassing knowledge is something “only the gods can achieve”. What mankind can do, however, is “to keep searching, keep revising our concepts and conclusions. That is, all we can do is to search for wisdom or, in other words, to philosophize.”. Aristotle, along similar lines, argues that the best life is reserved for someone with theoretical knowledge (sophia) about the cosmos and the laws of nature, and the ability to practically apply moral knowledge (phrónesis). This is the best way to suppress the base part of the human mind.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the practical case for why Socrates justifies his life of contemplation amidst a scathing attack by Callicles. Callicles argues that Socrates has left the “city and the agoras”, the places where individuals become “highly distinguished”, and would “die” if a “very lowly and vicious accuser… wished to demand the death penalty for you”. The implication is that Socrates’ life of contemplation serves no practical end, not even the basic need of self-preservation, let alone the higher needs of meeting one’s potential. In response, Socrates makes the case that “the true man” (as opposed to the “distinguished man”) “must reject living any amount of time whatsoever, and must not be a lover of life”. This is a spiritual call to eschew worldly attachment. Further, “believing… that no man may escape his destiny, he must investigate what comes after this: In what way may he who is going to live for a time live best?”. The analogy of the Thessalian women introduces a mythological element to his argument. The hubristic women in Thessaly, using their place in the planet for selfish purposes, represent the risk of losing “the things dearest to us” while pursuing “power in the city”. To the contrary, the life of contemplation encourages moderation and thought, and ultimately is the definition of a “good” life.</p>
<p>In summary, Socrates, in Gorgias, makes the case for the life of contemplation. A common theme in this text is the rift between how things appear to be and what things are — misinformed belief versus informed knowledge, desires versus elevated, pain versus redemption, pleasure versus corruption. The conclusions reached by Socrates have clear implications for how we should think about freedom and moral obligation. Specific to speech, there is a strong case for restricting speech that seeks only to persuade and not to appeal to the people’s higher faculties and “goodness”. Broadly, in leading the good life, our freedoms should also be constrained by a broader sense of right and wrong. The best way to achieve this is through a process of contemplation and deliberation. While perfect knowledge is impossible, the process of contemplation alone is a pathway to a good life.</p>
11:T1f88,<p>Here’s Part II of my reflections from my happiness exploration journey: this one’s on my trip to Scandinavia!</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=what-makes-scandinavia-so-happy&#x26;img=images%2Fhelsinkiharbour.jpeg" alt="Helsinki Harbour"></p>
<p>One can’t speak about shaping happiness without bringing up examples from at least one of the five Nordic countries — Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Should we believe the rankings — are the Nordic countries genuinely the happiest countries in the world? If so, how?</p>
<p>In my journey learning about happiness and how to promote it, I wanted to answer these questions. To do so, I took a trip to Helsinki (Finland), Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen and Aarhus (Denmark).</p>
<p>Before I get to what I learnt there, here’s some context. A long time ago, people used to think happiness was not within our control. It was divinely ordained— if you’re happy, it’s because you pleased the gods. If you aren’t, then you’ve done something really wrong.</p>
<p>However, over time, people realised that there are certain things you can do to influence your overall life satisfaction. From there, promoting the happiness of their people became a key aim of governments: Aristotle believed the goal of the state was to help its citizens achieve eudaimonia — long-term happiness and flourishing. I found this idea interesting. In my opinion, the state can implement policies that foster the conditions for happiness. However, ultimately, a lot hinges on the people’s psyches and approaches to life. It’s this second bit that I wanted to delve deeper into during my trip.</p>
<p>I spent my time in the three countries immersing myself in the local culture and having casual conversations with many locals. I also had the opportunity to chat with three professors from Sweden and Denmark, in the fields of geography, sociology, and economics, to hear their perspectives. So: Are the Nordic countries as happy as they are said to be? Well, sort of.</p>
<p>People in all three countries shared that they see themselves as “contented” with their lives rather than outwardly happy or “smiley”.</p>
<p>For one, it’s a matter of perspective. “Danes don’t complain,” one shared — “they’d rather see even the bad days as an opportunity for hygge.” What’s hygge? Roughly, this Danish word translates to feeling cosy. In Denmark, people often enjoy lighting a candle, making hot chocolate, and wrapping themselves in a thick blanket. But that’s not the only form of hygge. Volunteering with an NGO (which, according to a Danish professor I met at a cafe in Aarhus, is a commonplace practice among Danes), cycling around the streets, and even tackling a challenging problem at work that will make life easier for one’s colleagues can all be seen as hygge.</p>
<p>What else explains this contentment?</p>
<p>I think the people of the Nordic countries prefer to see humans as just that — humans. They sought to build an incredibly egalitarian society. According to a professor I met from Stockholm University, outlandish displays of class, such as fancy cars or grand homes, are eschewed. Instead, people prefer to remain humble and treat everyone with equal respect. In Sweden, they have a word for this — lagom. Naturally, this engenders more contentment with one’s state of things. And, of course, basic necessities are often provided to citizens, given the strong welfare state in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>Perhaps one symbol of egalitarianism is the Finnish sauna. It’s a haven for most Finns, and a not-to-be-missed experience. Saunas are a hugely important means of relaxation for the Finns, and yet they are incredibly accessible to people of all backgrounds. It’s not like a fancy restaurant that ends with an astronomical bill, or a visit to a theme park that can be out of reach for many. You’d see people of many different backgrounds coming together in saunas.</p>
<p>Secondly — and this is a significant point — interpersonal trust is a foundational part of Nordic citizens’ contentment. It was surprising to me that citizens in the Nordic countries accept the high tax rates. I asked a Swedish professor of sociology about this. “A good life isn’t just one where you’re wealthy”, she said, “it’s one where you can also help others in your community”.</p>
<p>Regarding unemployment benefits, the Swedes don’t believe that most unemployed individuals are lazy or averse to work. Instead, they might have taken a risk and failed, or have to take time off to reskill. Again, the trust to assume the best in one another enables people to accept that helping others is a source of joy for oneself. As a side benefit, according to my guide at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm, the knowledge that others have your back also promotes risk-taking innovation, explaining why the Nordic countries have managed to lead the way in many fields.</p>
<p>Of course, the other half of the equation is that even the wealthy benefit from the taxes they pay — a Finn I met at a forest cleanup shared that most Finns are incredibly happy with the public education and healthcare system, to which all Fins have access and benefit from. The quality of public services prevents a system where there is all the downside and no upside for most of the tax base.</p>
<p>Finally, the Nordic countries have a strong focus on relationships. It is undeniable that our loved ones are treasured sources of well-being. When I visited the Happiness Research Institute’s museum in Copenhagen, I walked into a room filled with Post-it notes on which visitors had written down what made them happy. Not a single Post-it note mentioned money or work. Most talked about their family, significant others, and pets.</p>
<p>The trust I mentioned earlier provides a strong foundation for autonomy at the workplace. Managers trust employees to complete their work to a high standard, and employees trust that their managers are looking out for them, removing obstacles where necessary. According to the Danish professor I spoke with, the state generally refrains from intervening in the relationship between employer and employee. Much is left to mutual trust.</p>
<p>“We’re not averse to working on weekends”, said a Finn I met at a cafe in Helsinki, “if the work needs to get done, we’ll get it done”. Interestingly, the people I spoke to didn’t refer to this as work-life balance. They shared that the line is blurred — but not in a bad way. At least to the people I spoke with, work is a positive addition to life.</p>
<p>Yet, there was a clear understanding that work is just one part of life. Culturally (and not just ideologically), co-workers are accommodating when new parents take half a year off with their babies, or work fewer hours if their children are unwell. Family time is treasured and valued in the Nordic countries, and this is undoubtedly a great source of contentment.</p>
<p>Are the Nordic countries perfect? Certainly not. They face their fair share of issues, and it would be impossible for me, as a tourist in the summertime, to see the nuanced realities and potential underlying challenges of life in these countries long-term.</p>
<p>However, my experience in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark has shown that governments can indeed play a significant role in fostering happiness. Ensuring high levels of trust (not only in government, but also in one another), consultative leadership, and robust safety nets can help foster contentment. Alongside this, people must also build a culture where humility is valued over greed, collaboration is valued over competition, and trust is valued over suspicion. We all have it within us to take the first step in building that culture wherever we go.</p>
<p>It’s a hygge thought, but as I draft this article from my aeroplane seat on my way back to Singapore, I’m dreaming about what I want to do in my community to nurture happiness and contentment! See you next time!</p>
12:T1921,<p>When I started my application for the Gap Year Program, I carefully considered what I wanted to learn in these twelve months.</p>
<p>I wanted to see the world, make an impact in my community, and learn more about myself. One unifying theme across these three certainties was the concept of well-being or happiness, so I decided to explore that this year.</p>
<p>Almost everyone wants to be happy, whatever that means to them. Most philosophies and ideologies have implicit answers about what a “happy” life entails, but indeed, for many, the answer lies within.</p>
<p>Over the last year, my journey in learning about happiness has taken me to beautiful nature views, austere office buildings, 15-hour flights, and new cities. I hope to share my thoughts and reflections in a three-part blog post that starts today.</p>
<p>In this first post, I want to share more about my 3-week-long hiking trip in Nepal. Three friends and I walked around the Annapurna Sanctuary trails, including one night at the base camp of Annapurna, a magnificent range of mountains over 8000m high. </p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=reflections-from-the-himalayas&#x26;img=images%2Fnepalheader.png" alt="NepalCoverPhoto"></p>
<p>Flying into Nepal, it was amazing how people of all ages, including myself, were magnetically drawn to the aeroplane window, eager to catch a glimpse of the majestic mountains. The sight of the glistening peaks never ceased to amaze me. It’s no wonder the locals believe these peaks are home to the gods. </p>
<p>I think living in harmony with nature is a source of happiness for the Nepalese. My tour guide charmingly referred to the mountains like good friends: “He’s sleeping in the clouds today,” “He says good morning!” </p>
<p>Before going to Nepal, I had a theory. I believed that geography influences your definition of a good life — and, in turn, influences your happiness. If designer outlets and fancy cars exclusively surround you, then the meaning of the good life is the possession of material wealth. Not having something is a source of discontent. Having something is a source of fleeting joy, but it soon wears off. Researchers call this the Hedonic Treadmill.</p>
<p>For the Nepali friends I spoke to on my hike, simply seeing the mountains come out beautifully is a source of immense joy. It tells them that human-made concerns are ultimately just that. We could all use some of that thinking.</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=reflections-from-the-himalayas&#x26;img=images%2Fnepal4.png" alt="nepal4"></p>
<p>Can we expand our capacity for happiness? After returning to Singapore, I explored the psychology of happiness to gain a deeper understanding of the concept. Psychologists came up with a calculable theory of happiness, known as the “set point theory”. H (Happiness) = S (Set Value) + C (Circumstances) + A (Actions). The second two are intuitive — if your life is filled with happy circumstances, and you act in a way that promotes your well-being, then happiness is a natural consequence. </p>
<p>The interesting thing here, though, is that some believe that happiness is influenced by the mysterious S. This “set point” theory of happiness argues that our capacity for joy is, to some extent, pre-ordained. It’s determined by genetic factors, and to some extent, the “baselines” we set in our minds for what constitutes an unhappy, everyday, or happy life. In other words, our genetic makeup and our past experiences play a significant role in determining our baseline level of happiness. </p>
<p>In Nepal, expanding my capacity for happiness felt very much possible. My tour guide always referred to this as a matter of perspective. “I know our legs are sore,” he said around 70km (45 miles) into our hike. “But doesn’t this beautiful view make it all worth it?”</p>
<p>My trip to Nepal fundamentally forced me to rethink my calculus of effort and reward. Unlike other holidays, Nepal forced me to work extra hard to enjoy the extra beautiful rewards of a calm night staying in a tea house (a lodge) in the mountains. Amidst the leg cramps on my way to our tea house and the lack of creature comforts, I was still happy because I knew that the challenges were just a natural part of this incredible experience. </p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=reflections-from-the-himalayas&#x26;img=images%2Fnepal3.png" alt="nepal3"></p>
<p>My final reflection is about happiness and community. Nepal taught me that the happiness of one is fundamentally interconnected with the happiness of all. This philosophy featured prominently in the Buddhist and Hindu philosophies of happiness that I read about before my trip. These philosophies emphasise the importance of compassion, kindness, and interconnectedness in achieving genuine happiness. The compassionate and kind Nepali people are a living testament to this idea. </p>
<p>The Nepali people I came across in small villages on my trek were a testament to the idea that we always have more love to give. My day was always made sweeter by the friendly “Namaste! Have a good day!” of the locals — eventually, my friends and I picked up this habit and started wishing the same to everyone we saw along the way. Simply wishing someone well made us feel happier.</p>
<p>Nepal taught us to appreciate the non-human joys along the way. The sight of a beautiful flower or a friendly dog that walked almost 10km alongside us (leading the way for most of the walk) filled us with gratitude. We learned to take some time to stop and appreciate the beauty of the rhododendrons (Nepal’s national flower) and shower endless praise for the good boy who joined our walk. Gratitude not only enriched others but also enriched us, filling our hearts with a sense of contentment. </p>

<p>My three weeks in Nepal were incredible — I’ve done my best to put in words the feeling of being amongst the world’s highest mountains, but nothing compares to feeling it on your own. I would recommend that anyone who can catch a 2–3-week break should seize this opportunity — you’re sure to have a relaxing and breathtaking journey!  And hopefully, just like me, you’ll find clarity in the questions you want to answer for yourself. See you in my next post!</p>
13:T1321,<p>Racial enclaves are a prevalent phenomenon in many countries around the world. Why is this the case?</p>
<p>The simple explanation — that most people are racist and exclusively choose to stay closer to those who look similar to them — doesn’t go very far as an explanation. It seems counter-intuitive to many.</p>
<p><strong>So, how exactly does structural discrimination happen?</strong></p>
<p>In our Economics class, we played a little game. There’s a 10x10 grid in this game, and there are two groups — the Yellow Triangles and the Blue Squares. The game assumes that you prefer to have at least 1/3rd of your neighbors being in the same group as you — something which seems relatively reasonable.</p>
<p>The game starts with a random distribution of Yellow Triangles and Blue Squares. The characters are agitated unless at least 1 of the three neighboring shapes closest to them are of the same group. Your job is to move them around until all of the characters are no longer agitated. Try the game out here.</p>
<p>The below is the random state of the beginning of the game. The characters with shocked faces are agitated, and need to be moved around.</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=structural-discrimination-eip&#x26;img=images%2Feip1.jpg" alt="eip1"></p>
<p>You move, and you move again, and all of a sudden, your city looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/api/writing/image?slug=structural-discrimination-eip&#x26;img=images%2Feip2.jpg" alt="eip2"></p>
<p>That’s far more discriminated &#x26; separated than before! This is precisely how enclaves are born.</p>
<p>Ok, so what if people live around people of the same group as them? I have two responses to this.</p>
<p>Firstly, that undermines the solidarity of civic societies. For individuals in countries to feel part of a broader national project, there has to be intermixing. This is precisely the point Michael Sandel makes in Justice: What’s the right thing to do?. `</p>
<p>Secondly, such living patterns creates opportunities for structural discrimination. What is structural discrimination? This topic first requires some myth busting. It is NOT the same as what we think of as racism, sexism or all the other -isms — it doesn’t have to be tasted-based. In fact, it can happen due to innocent reasons. This is what makes structural discrimination dangerous.</p>
<p>For example, when the Interstate Highway System was built in the US, many highways were built right smack in the middle of marginalized communities because land prices were lower there. The decision to build a highway right in the middle of such communities further lowered land prices due to the externalities of having a highway there (e.g. noise &#x26; air pollution). Since land is a store of wealth for many families, this harmed generations of already lower-income, marginalized communities.</p>
<p>How do we prevent this? I would argue that Singapore’s Ethnic Integration Policy offers an interesting approach.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore’s EIP</strong></p>
<p>80% of Singaporeans live in public housing, called HDB flats. These HDB flats are socially engineered to promote racial integration — the racial proportions living in each flat generally reflect that of broader societies. When you apply to buy a HDB flat, you aren’t guaranteed to get the flat just by forking out enough money — these quotas are kept in mind.</p>
<p>What is the consequence? Singaporeans consistently rub shoulders with people of different ethnic groups. By consequence of living in the same area, children of different groups go to similar schools, making schools another avenue of social mixing. These interactions facilitate stronger bonds amongst Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Can the EIP make everything perfect? Likely not. Just living next to one another doesn’t mean you’d necessarily befriend your neighbors or even talk to one another. In fact, Singapore has seen neighborly conflicts take on a racial character on a few occasions.</p>
<p>Even if not perfect, I believe the EIP avoids the worse scenario of little inter-mixing between ethnicities. In that sense, it is a good example of using social engineering to build a civic society.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing the EIP through a different lens</strong></p>
<p>Before having tried my hand at the simulation, I didn’t realize how easy it is for enclaves to form. My study of economics revealed the significant harms that arise when enclaves exist. Through this, I realized how important the EIP is as a policy.</p>
<p>My next question is: is there a way to maximize the benefits of the EIP by encouraging the spirit of neighborly interactions, such that living amongst people of different cultures &#x26; ethnicities is not just tokenistic? That’s something for me to think about. My guess is that this must organically evolve, possible through civil society, not from government.</p>
