explores rhetoric, power, and pathways to the good life. In this reflection, I will examine Socrates’ view of (a) rhetoric, its power and the need for it to be moderated, (b) the disjunct between appearance and reality on questions of pleasure, pain, good and bad, and (c) the need for philosophy and contemplation to live the good life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, Gorgias establishes that rhetoricians are influential. Socrates does not contest that in his context, rhetoricians are influential (“[rhetoric] manifestly appears to me as a power demonic in greatness”). (emphasis added) He sees rhetoric’s power to spur action, from how he concedes that indeed, great rhetoricians’ counsel inspired the building of dockyards, harbours and city walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Socrates establishes how rhetoric’s power does not always serve good causes. This is because the skill of persuasion, in itself, is not grounded in any fundamental truths or morality. Rhetoricians’ public speech can destabilise truth and authorities of truth. For example, should a rhetorician and a doctor “have to contest in speech… which of the two ought to be chosen doctor”, it would be the rhetorician — “the man with the power to speak” — that an uninformed audience would choose. Gorgias concedes that with the “great” power of rhetoric, rhetoricians ought to “​​use rhetoric, Socrates, just as every other competitive skill” including “boxing and pankration and fighting in heavy armour”, because of its harm it might cause. With this, we cannot take the assumption that all rhetoricians are well-intentioned and knowledgeable in matters of justice — “of necessity know[ing] the just and unjust things, either beforehand or by learning them later from [Gorgias]”. Gorgias himself acknowledges the harm that might arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocrates also empirically establishes how ineffective public rhetoric has been at promoting good virtue in citizens. Instead, it solely speaks to people’s desires without accounting for what is fundamentally good to them. This parallels how cookery satisfies people’s desires while medicine examines what is good for someone. To Socrates, rhetoric flatters (“supplying the city with the things it desired”) but does not succeed at “leading [people’s] desires in a different direction” and “persuading and forcing [citizens] toward the condition in which the citizens were to be better” — which is the ultimate goal of a polis in Ancient Greece. To the contrary, rhetoricians, including Pericles, seem to have made their audiences “more savage”, and therefore “more unjust and worse”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemporary examples show that not all persuasive individuals use their persuasion to advance the truth, or promote goodness. Half-truths, such as President Bill Clinton’s misleading cover-up of his sexual harassment case, are increasingly common. More concerningly, inflammatory speech and actions appealing to people’s emotions, such as that used by Alternative für Deutschland in Germany, is harmful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho has the duty to ensure that misleading speech does not cause harm? Is it the speaker, or the listener? I believe that Socrates passingly addresses this. In drawing the distinction between inspiring knowledge and inspiring belief, Socrates acknowledges that the orator “would not be able… to teach so large a mob such great matters in a short time”. Arguably, Socrates is cognizant that audiences might not be able to grasp the whole truth. Indeed, today, we rely on experts to fill in knowledge gaps, and many of us take their word to be true. During the COVID pandemic, we trusted that epidemiologists know what they do. This further contextualized why Fish, Stanley and Simpson argued for no platforming — given universities’ pursuit to advance truth and confidence in the truth, any speech from such persuasive orators which harms trust in universities and their academic process should be restricted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy issue with this argument, though, is that the same principle could be applied to the rest of society as well — and I think Socrates too makes the case for general restrictions to free speech, not just in specific settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this is to say, perhaps Socrates would be sympathetic towards restrictions on harmful free speech, simply because he does not have full faith in there being a discerning audience that can parse speech and find the truth, nor does he have full faith in public rhetoricians to nurture good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting from the societal effects of rhetoricians’ power to how this power affects rhetoricians (and all powerful people), Socrates first examines means to be powerful. Polus argues that power is having options — in his case, orators are powerful because they may “kill whomever they wish, and confiscate possessions, and expel from the cities whomever it seems good to them”. There are few restrictions to a powerful person’s freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, Socrates contends that for someone intending to live the much-desired good life, unfettered freedom is not the way to go. In his argument, I interpreted the concept of the distinction between the higher good as rising above base desires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocrates makes an interesting semantic distinction, between what one “wish[es]”, and what “seems to them to be best”. I thought the word “wish” was interesting — it reveals a sense of aspiration, something elevated. “Seems”, on the other hand, is surface level. It is confined to the realm of appearances. Perhaps this understanding is not unique to Socrates. Polus too acknowledges this, having conceded that the man who does something that seems good but is indeed bad “does not seem… to do what he wishes”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting from the semantic to the philosophical, Socrates makes arguments distinguishing the base and the noble throughout this text. For example, Socrates proves that even though punishment might be painful, this is still abstractly good (possibly, good for the soul). This is most powerfully conveyed by the inversion of the word “wretched”. There are two meanings that this word carries, one belonging to Polus and one belonging to Socrates. In 469a, “wretched” is defined by Socrates as a spiritual degradation, in response to acting unjustly. When Polus uses the same word in 472e, to define how one would feel if punished, Socrates is quick to refute it — to Socrates punishment is a form of redemption, painful on the surface but healing within. What is the implication of this? Freedom should be exercised with the necessary discernment. Such discernment enables one to determine what is truly good, versus what appeals to our desires but might not be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow may one get better at discernment? I would argue that Socrates has a clear answer: knowledge and philosophy. In the text, it is acknowledged by both Polus and Socrates that “doing what seems good without intelligence is a bad thing”. Knowledge promotes discernment needed to prevent one from using their power to their own detriment, doing “unjust and based things”. In the example we discussed in class regarding our professor’ son and his desire for a baseball bat, I perceived this as a case of falsely valuing the baseball bat. In the absence of knowledge, we falsely value the item. Even amongst highly educated people, such cognitive distortions are common. The most prominent example is how we often weigh immediate pleasures more than future pleasures — this is why we find it easier to have those extra one or two donuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowledge also prevents the excess of ambition, temptation and desire that “thoughtless”, “uninitiated” (493b) might face. Instead, they may enjoy an “orderly” life (493d). This word carries some additional meaning given the Greeks, famously Aristotle, believed in a natural order. If order in a civil society is a dream worth aspiring to, knowledge is the way to get there, according to Socrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs true knowledge possible? According to an article by Julian Dutra published by the University of Chicago’s Center for Practical wisdom, Socrates argued that perfect, all-encompassing knowledge is something “only the gods can achieve”. What mankind can do, however, is “to keep searching, keep revising our concepts and conclusions. That is, all we can do is to search for wisdom or, in other words, to philosophize.”. Aristotle, along similar lines, argues that the best life is reserved for someone with theoretical knowledge (sophia) about the cosmos and the laws of nature, and the ability to practically apply moral knowledge (phrónesis). This is the best way to suppress the base part of the human mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, this is the practical case for why Socrates justifies his life of contemplation amidst a scathing attack by Callicles. Callicles argues that Socrates has left the “city and the agoras”, the places where individuals become “highly distinguished”, and would “die” if a “very lowly and vicious accuser… wished to demand the death penalty for you”. The implication is that Socrates’ life of contemplation serves no practical end, not even the basic need of self-preservation, let alone the higher needs of meeting one’s potential. In response, Socrates makes the case that “the true man” (as opposed to the “distinguished man”) “must reject living any amount of time whatsoever, and must not be a lover of life”. This is a spiritual call to eschew worldly attachment. Further, “believing… that no man may escape his destiny, he must investigate what comes after this: In what way may he who is going to live for a time live best?”. The analogy of the Thessalian women introduces a mythological element to his argument. The hubristic women in Thessaly, using their place in the planet for selfish purposes, represent the risk of losing “the things dearest to us” while pursuing “power in the city”. To the contrary, the life of contemplation encourages moderation and thought, and ultimately is the definition of a “good” life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary, Socrates, in Gorgias, makes the case for the life of contemplation. A common theme in this text is the rift between how things appear to be and what things are — misinformed belief versus informed knowledge, desires versus elevated, pain versus redemption, pleasure versus corruption. The conclusions reached by Socrates have clear implications for how we should think about freedom and moral obligation. Specific to speech, there is a strong case for restricting speech that seeks only to persuade and not to appeal to the people’s higher faculties and “goodness”. Broadly, in leading the good life, our freedoms should also be constrained by a broader sense of right and wrong. The best way to achieve this is through a process of contemplation and deliberation. While perfect knowledge is impossible, the process of contemplation alone is a pathway to a good life.\u003c/p\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"f:T1f88,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003cp\u003eHere’s Part II of my reflections from my happiness exploration journey: this one’s on my trip to Scandinavia!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/api/writing/image?slug=what-makes-scandinavia-so-happy\u0026#x26;img=images%2Fhelsinkiharbour.jpeg\" alt=\"Helsinki Harbour\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne can’t speak about shaping happiness without bringing up examples from at least one of the five Nordic countries — Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Should we believe the rankings — are the Nordic countries genuinely the happiest countries in the world? If so, how?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my journey learning about happiness and how to promote it, I wanted to answer these questions. To do so, I took a trip to Helsinki (Finland), Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen and Aarhus (Denmark).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I get to what I learnt there, here’s some context. A long time ago, people used to think happiness was not within our control. It was divinely ordained— if you’re happy, it’s because you pleased the gods. If you aren’t, then you’ve done something really wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, over time, people realised that there are certain things you can do to influence your overall life satisfaction. From there, promoting the happiness of their people became a key aim of governments: Aristotle believed the goal of the state was to help its citizens achieve eudaimonia — long-term happiness and flourishing. I found this idea interesting. In my opinion, the state can implement policies that foster the conditions for happiness. However, ultimately, a lot hinges on the people’s psyches and approaches to life. It’s this second bit that I wanted to delve deeper into during my trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent my time in the three countries immersing myself in the local culture and having casual conversations with many locals. I also had the opportunity to chat with three professors from Sweden and Denmark, in the fields of geography, sociology, and economics, to hear their perspectives. So: Are the Nordic countries as happy as they are said to be? Well, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople in all three countries shared that they see themselves as “contented” with their lives rather than outwardly happy or “smiley”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one, it’s a matter of perspective. “Danes don’t complain,” one shared — “they’d rather see even the bad days as an opportunity for hygge.” What’s hygge? Roughly, this Danish word translates to feeling cosy. In Denmark, people often enjoy lighting a candle, making hot chocolate, and wrapping themselves in a thick blanket. But that’s not the only form of hygge. Volunteering with an NGO (which, according to a Danish professor I met at a cafe in Aarhus, is a commonplace practice among Danes), cycling around the streets, and even tackling a challenging problem at work that will make life easier for one’s colleagues can all be seen as hygge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else explains this contentment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the people of the Nordic countries prefer to see humans as just that — humans. They sought to build an incredibly egalitarian society. According to a professor I met from Stockholm University, outlandish displays of class, such as fancy cars or grand homes, are eschewed. Instead, people prefer to remain humble and treat everyone with equal respect. In Sweden, they have a word for this — lagom. Naturally, this engenders more contentment with one’s state of things. And, of course, basic necessities are often provided to citizens, given the strong welfare state in the Nordic countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps one symbol of egalitarianism is the Finnish sauna. It’s a haven for most Finns, and a not-to-be-missed experience. Saunas are a hugely important means of relaxation for the Finns, and yet they are incredibly accessible to people of all backgrounds. It’s not like a fancy restaurant that ends with an astronomical bill, or a visit to a theme park that can be out of reach for many. You’d see people of many different backgrounds coming together in saunas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly — and this is a significant point — interpersonal trust is a foundational part of Nordic citizens’ contentment. It was surprising to me that citizens in the Nordic countries accept the high tax rates. I asked a Swedish professor of sociology about this. “A good life isn’t just one where you’re wealthy”, she said, “it’s one where you can also help others in your community”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding unemployment benefits, the Swedes don’t believe that most unemployed individuals are lazy or averse to work. Instead, they might have taken a risk and failed, or have to take time off to reskill. Again, the trust to assume the best in one another enables people to accept that helping others is a source of joy for oneself. As a side benefit, according to my guide at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm, the knowledge that others have your back also promotes risk-taking innovation, explaining why the Nordic countries have managed to lead the way in many fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the other half of the equation is that even the wealthy benefit from the taxes they pay — a Finn I met at a forest cleanup shared that most Finns are incredibly happy with the public education and healthcare system, to which all Fins have access and benefit from. The quality of public services prevents a system where there is all the downside and no upside for most of the tax base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Nordic countries have a strong focus on relationships. It is undeniable that our loved ones are treasured sources of well-being. When I visited the Happiness Research Institute’s museum in Copenhagen, I walked into a room filled with Post-it notes on which visitors had written down what made them happy. Not a single Post-it note mentioned money or work. Most talked about their family, significant others, and pets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trust I mentioned earlier provides a strong foundation for autonomy at the workplace. Managers trust employees to complete their work to a high standard, and employees trust that their managers are looking out for them, removing obstacles where necessary. According to the Danish professor I spoke with, the state generally refrains from intervening in the relationship between employer and employee. Much is left to mutual trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not averse to working on weekends”, said a Finn I met at a cafe in Helsinki, “if the work needs to get done, we’ll get it done”. Interestingly, the people I spoke to didn’t refer to this as work-life balance. They shared that the line is blurred — but not in a bad way. At least to the people I spoke with, work is a positive addition to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, there was a clear understanding that work is just one part of life. Culturally (and not just ideologically), co-workers are accommodating when new parents take half a year off with their babies, or work fewer hours if their children are unwell. Family time is treasured and valued in the Nordic countries, and this is undoubtedly a great source of contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre the Nordic countries perfect? Certainly not. They face their fair share of issues, and it would be impossible for me, as a tourist in the summertime, to see the nuanced realities and potential underlying challenges of life in these countries long-term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, my experience in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark has shown that governments can indeed play a significant role in fostering happiness. Ensuring high levels of trust (not only in government, but also in one another), consultative leadership, and robust safety nets can help foster contentment. Alongside this, people must also build a culture where humility is valued over greed, collaboration is valued over competition, and trust is valued over suspicion. We all have it within us to take the first step in building that culture wherever we go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a hygge thought, but as I draft this article from my aeroplane seat on my way back to Singapore, I’m dreaming about what I want to do in my community to nurture happiness and contentment!
