I’m starting a new series called Last Week Tonight, where I’ll recap some of the interesting things I learnt over last week as a college student at Duke University. 

This first week of classes was really only two days long - Wednesday and Thursday. With that, there’s really only one big point I want to talk about: **climate anxiety**. 

**What is climate anxiety?**

This term was first introduced to me by my climate change professor. Climate anxiety is akin to a genuine mental health condition — it is anxiety whose root cause is environmental degradation. Climate anxiety is fundamentally tied to the daily churn of doomsday predictions about where our climate is headed.

Data suggests that climate anxiety is more prevalent than I thought. A survey of 10,000 youths from 10 countries found that 59% were “extremely concerned about climate change” and expressed negative emotions, including anger and anxiety (Avaaz, 2021). That’s almost 3 in 5 youths! (I’ll reflect more on what I think about this statistic later.)

Certainly, anxiety is bad, and societies should be doing our best to deal with climate anxiety. In fact, our lecturer shared how some of his colleagues in the climate science field told him that the doomsday message of his class was harming advocacy efforts by causing climate anxiety. 

To them, depicting the potential for tremendous climate harm is good, *to an end*. After that, we should start talking about solutions, and explaining to students how we have all the knowledge on dealing with climate anxiety. “We’re Doomed, But We Can Fix It”.

Here’s the issue with the “We’re Doomed, But We Can Fix It” narrative. Perhaps it seems just… too easy. It seems like the kind of trope you would see in a Hollywood movie which ends happily ever after. A feel-good narrative can sometimes obscure the genuine tradeoffs that people will have to make for climate action. 

Feel-good narratives can also pave the way to feel-good solutions that don’t end up actually dealing with climate change. Many readers would hear their governments talk about their climate strategies. But what tradeoffs have we had to make for those climate strategies? In the words of my professor, we should be suspicious of any climate initiatives that involve zero tradeoffs (e.g. fewer cars, less water usage). So much climate “progress”, for example, revolves around countries buying carbon credits. The idea behind carbon credits is that we can offset emissions made in Sydney, Australia (for example) by “investing” in a carbon removal project elsewhere in the world. There are several key issues with this system, and I’ll include a Gemini primer on some of those issues at the bottom of this article. 

Insofar as the “We’re Doomed, But We Can Fix This” narrative could cause such inaction (while giving ourselves delusions that it’s always going to be fixable maybe tomorrow, maybe 5 years from now), we should understand that unwarranted optimism can cause significant harm. 

However, pessimism is toxic as well. I talked about how climate anxiety is psychologically painful for those going through it. But there are also broader societal effects when you zoom out. When climate anxiety causes people to throw their hands up and simply say “We Can’t Fix This; So Let’s Continue Life As Is”, we’re almost certainly racing towards irreversible climate destruction.

How do we toe the line between optimistic, feel-good narratives and pessimistic, doomsday narratives? There’s no fixed answer, but here’s a thought: we could use some climate anxiety. 

Three in five youths are losing sleep over climate change? I’m not very sure about that, at least in a Singaporean context. We typically lead our lives as usual, knowing that climate change is abstract *there*, *somewhere*, but that has no real effect on our lives. Yes, we need to run the air-conditioner more, or build higher seawalls so that our countries wouldn’t be flooded by rising sea levels. 

Youths in (relatively) richer countries are not wrong in thinking that they’re probably shielded from the worst effects of climate change. That’s probably why their climate anxiety is abstract at best, and virtue signaling at worst. 

Here’s where I disagree: I think our climate anxiety should be a collective *human* anxiety. Youths in Singapore should be worried about youths in low-lying areas of Myanmar, who are more vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels. Maybe it shouldn’t even be collective *human* anxiety — it should be a concern for *life and dignity* as a whole, including that of animals and biodiversity. 

My solution seems like grandly delusional as well. But I think this is a first step towards dealing with one of the fundamental reasons why climate degradation is such a challenging problem — the idea that you can squeeze the balloon on one side, and feel good on that side, while people on the other side are suffering. For example, you can export all your waste to other countries for “recycling” (and feel good about yourself), while the other country might actually be burning it and causing pollution. 

I’ll be thinking more about this tension throughout this semester.

Gemini’s primer on why carbon credits are a flawed solution: 

**1. The "Additionality" Problem (The Counterfactual Trap)**

For a carbon credit to be valid, it must be **additional**. This means the project (like planting a forest) would *not* have happened without the money from the credit sale.

- **The Issue:** Proving a "what if" scenario is nearly impossible. Many projects—such as wind farms that were already profitable or forests that weren't actually at risk of being cut down—sell credits for actions they were going to take anyway.
- **Result:** The buyer continues to emit CO2, but the "offset" doesn't actually result in a *new* reduction. Total global emissions go up.

**2. The Permanence Risk**

Carbon emitted from burning fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere for centuries. Many carbon credits, however, rely on nature-based solutions that are temporary.

- **The Issue:** A forest planted today might burn down in a wildfire in 20 years, or be cut down due to a change in local government.
- **Result:** The carbon stored is released back into the atmosphere, but the credit has already been used to "cancel out" permanent fossil fuel emissions.

**3. Leakage (Moving the Problem)**

Leakage occurs when protecting one area simply shifts the damaging activity to another.

- **Example:** If a credit pays a logging company to stop cutting down trees in "Forest A," that company might simply move its equipment and cut down "Forest B" instead.
- **Result:** On paper, Forest A is saved, and credits are sold. In reality, the net impact on the atmosphere is zero.

**4. Verification and "Phantom" Credits**

The carbon market is often fragmented and lacks a single, global regulator.

- **The Issue:** Investigative reports (such as those in 2023 and 2024 regarding major certifiers like Verra) have found that a vast majority of "avoided deforestation" credits did not represent genuine carbon savings. These are often called **phantom credits**.
- **The Scale:** Some studies have estimated that less than 16% of certain categories of credits represent actual, measurable emissions reductions.
