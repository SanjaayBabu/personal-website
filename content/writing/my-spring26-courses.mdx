Tomorrow is my First Day of Classes in Spring 2026! After a lovely break in the UK over winter, I’m ready to start my next wave of classes this semester. 

Before I begin classes proper, I want to talk about the classes I’m taking, and my reasoning behind taking those classes. 

**Earth and Climate Sciences: Climate Change for Future Leaders**

I regularly hear how much of an issue climate change is; often, powerful rhetoric is used to describe the danger being done, and promptly, advocates move on to talking about solutions. 

I understand why advocates need to use rhetoric and quickly jump into solutions — after all, they are simply playing within the rules of the game, trying to appeal to people in a low-attention environment. 

However, personally, I wanted to take some time to really understand how our climate works, and what exactly is happening under the hood when we talk about climate change. With this, I can better make sense of the climate data that is coming out, and therefore better conceive of how we can solve the problems that come with climate change. 

**Mathematics: Calculus II**

Calculus II has a tough reputation at Duke. It's known as a “weed out course”. How exactly does it differ from the calculus I did for the 'A' level? 

While the 'A' level did a good job at teaching us how to *use* calculus, Calc II in college will delve deeper into how exactly calculus works. This course, again, allows me to understand what’s happening under the hood in calculus.

Calc II is also critical in building up towards multivariable calculus, a necessary field for students intending to study Economics, particularly through a more quantitative lens. 

I'm excited for this class because it'll be a challenge. Math is often not my comfort zone. However, learning to think like a mathematician is a valuable pursuit. I noticed that students in math have a systematic approach in dealing with problems in the face of limited information; this mindset is so valuable when dealing with challenging problems around us.  

**Economics: Foundations of Econometrics and Data Science**

Econometrics is the branch of economics concerned with the use of maths in describing economic systems. It has gained prominence in recent years, given efforts to make economics a more “scientific” field. 

This course will introduce me to the basics of econometrics — how statistical models are built, research design, sampling, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. 

I think this course will quite similar to what we learnt in H2 Mathematics at the GCE 'A' Level. That said, I hope this course will also go into more depth on how exactly the formulae works, as well as how to use coding platforms (e.g. STATA) in econometrics problems. 

This class is going to be an interesting one. We see statistics all around us to advocate for all kinds of arguments; for an engaged citizen, it's valuable to gain some clarity on how these studies are run and how results are interpreted. 

**Cultural Anthropology: Development and Africa**

I'm incredibly excited for this course. International development is a challenging problem.

Over the years, efforts to promote development in Africa have taken many forms: overseas development aid, multilateral aid, capability development, and more. While there has been relative success, there are big, systemic issues that remain unresolved. 

The sheer difficulty of the problem is not lost to many. The popular song Africa by TOTO goes “there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do”, the artist's reflection on how entrenched some of the challenges are in Africa. Yet, all of humanity ought to do more to lift up the poorest among us. We need to ensure that the basic needs (and rights) of those who live in Africa are met. How can we do better?

Here's a question I hope to answer: how can countries lift up other countries, without crossing the line into neocolonial intervention? Can this even be possible? 

**Writing: Wisdom in Comparative Rhetoric**

All Duke students are required to take a writing seminar. The aim of this seminar is us to learn about writing as a field. Yet, to make it interesting, the writing seminar revolves around a central theme.

The theme that I chose essentially asks: How do the Greek and Chinese traditions discuss the meaning of wisdom? How do different cultures use language to think and communicate? 

I chose this because of the interesting cross-cultural comparisons that could arise. In my philosophy class in Fall 2025, I noticed some similarities between the Bhagawad Gita’s conception of duty, and Immanuel Kant’s focus on acting on *a priori* moral duties rather than the consequences of actions. I found that fascinating, and that motivated me to take this writing seminar.

**Conclusion**

An exciting semester lies ahead — I hope to write more about the things I learn in school, so watch this space!
