Welcome to Part 2 of “Last Week Tonight”, where I recap some interesting things I learnt over the last week as a college student!

*A snowy weekend in Durham*

A major snowstorm has hit the US over this last weekend - as a result, we're getting some rare snow in Durham, NC! 

With the snow, not much has happened over the weekend - people are generally staying in and taking things easy. We're overall really lucky to have decent infrastructure in dealing with the snow - our power grid is intact, food/water is running smoothly, and we have heating.

It's times like this where we need to have more empathy and think about those who might not have access to these essential things. I hope that there are people looking out for those who might not have a shelter over their heads during these tough times.

*Rhetoric's place in society*

For my class on comparative rhetoric, we studied the origins of rhetorical studies in Ancient Greece. 

An interesting fact I learnt was that the rise of rhetoric is fundamentally linked to the birth of democracy. In a more crowded marketplace of ideas, one needs to be more well-versed in the art of verbal communication in order to have their ideas heard. Seeing Athenians' demands to get better at the art of oratory, a new group called the Sophists came to the forefront. These Sophists promised to teach their clients how to be skilled at speaking.

Their value was critical. Rhetoric is both (a) a source of power, and (b) restricted by power. In other words, through rhetoric, some people gain power. With the democratization of Athens, many people were no longer restricted by class or birthright in their right to express themselves and seek power. The Sophists, too, didn't restrict their speech tutoring services based on class or birthright - only with money. This was a big drift from the old belief that rhetorical abilities were god-granted: that the ability to speak well suggested a well-ordered mind and was not something that could be taught. The Sophists rejected this. With this, there was a whole new generation of "new money" who were looking for ways to unlock their newfound political agency.

Here's where things got problematic. Some Sophists claimed to be able to teach *arete* - virtue, courage, and bravery - through rhetoric. Here's where a troubling idea was introduced - rhetoric is a suitable replacement for genuine character or substance. It was this claim that Plato attacked in Gorgias. Plato suggested that rhetoric was merely a form of "flattery" to satisfy the audience's desires - similar to how "cookery" is the art of making palatable dishes. To Plato, this is far less admirable than the arts of gymnastics or medicine that are "real" skills and genuinely improve practitioners. Gorgias (a famous rhetorician and a character in Plato's dialogue) contradicts himself in a specific discussion about the relationship between rhetoric and virtue; initially, he argues that everyone who pursues rhetoric is "good" or "virtuous". However, through discourse with Socrates, he later concedes that rhetoric itself is ethically-blind - it can be used by vacuous, even bad people to flatter an audience and persuade them of a falsehood. 

I don't think we should exclusively look at people's rhetorical abilities to judge their place in society. It’s important for us to think about the voices that aren’t heard, because they both represent and perpetuate power imbalances in society that obstruct progress. Is it fair that rhetoric is so closely tied to power? I wonder. In some sense, insofar as rhetoric sometimes (and only for some people) makes power more attainable — compared to birthright or socio-economic status — it might be distributionally more fair. Yet, the fact that power is so closely tied to performance, instead of substantive virtue or qualities, is something we should be mindful about.

*Ecological destruction in the Sahel - 1968-1974*

For my class on African development, we explored various theories behind the Sahel famine in 1968. The Sahel is the "transition zone" in Africa between the more tropical countries of Cameroon and the Central African Republic, and the Saharan societies like Egypt and Libya. Countries in the Sahel include Mali, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. 

This famine in 1968 was a source of mass human suffering. Millions starved to death, and the effects of the famine lasted far beyond the short-term climate fluctuations - when food supplies were low, some farmers chose to consume the seeds that they would have used for crop regeneration; some herders killed their last animals that were meant to yield them long-term food and dairy supplies. International institutions were wrought with organizational inefficiencies, as they failed to bring sufficient food into the Sahel region at the time. Overall, the Sahel desert famine was one of the most tragic natural disasters in human history.

In line with a whole field seeking to study ways to address African "underdevelopment", there have been many theories for why the Sahel famine was as bad as it was. 

For some, climate is key. The Sahel famine was borne out of a drought - a fundamentally natural phenomenon. 

For others, it's all about land mismanagement. Herders overgrazed their land, and farmers didn't adopt the most wise farming techniques. 

The reading we read, "Seeds of Famine" by Franke and Chasin, argue that these are true enough, but that there is a bigger structural reason for why the Sahel famine was as bad as it was - colonial structures. 

A system of "indirect governance" during the colonial period had resulted in an erosion of the kinds of market economies that existed between the Sahel region and the tropics or Saharan Africa. How? Indirect rule essentially means that colonial administrators left day-to-day governance to locals. To do so, they created and exploited rivalries between various ethnic groups. This broke any trade relations they used to have. These trade relations were particularly important to the Sahel people whom, as residents of a transition zone, had more unpredictable food supplies and had to engage in trade.

Furthermore, the taxes that colonial governments imposed on the colonies cripped the ecology of the Sahel. Taxes had to be paid in European currencies - the only way that African countries could get the necessary European currencies was through selling commodities that Europeans wanted, or by working for European corporations. What did Europeans want from the Sahel? Peanuts. Why? Because nut oil was used as lubricant for the industrial machinery of Europe. The need to get European currency to pay taxes meant that entire farms were re-oriented towards peanut production. Peanuts had a deleterious effect on Sahel land - first, they consume scarce minerals in huge quantities. Second, when peanuts are harvested, the entire plant is removed from the ground. This means that when the strong harmattan winds blow across the Sahel region, there are no roots to hold the soil together; the soil is loose and sandy, allowing them to be blown away and therefore infertile for future crop production.

These two factors meant that entire systems that were in place to insulate Sahel food supplies from climatic variations had disappeared, leaving the Sahel particularly vulnerable to famines.

*Conclusion*

This week was a shorter week (we had a public holiday for MLK day last Monday) but still a meaningful one. I look forward to writing again next week!
