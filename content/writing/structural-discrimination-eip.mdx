Racial enclaves are a prevalent phenomenon in many countries around the world. Why is this the case?

The simple explanation — that most people are racist and exclusively choose to stay closer to those who look similar to them — doesn’t go very far as an explanation. It seems counter-intuitive to many.

**So, how exactly does structural discrimination happen?**

In our Economics class, we played a little game. There’s a 10x10 grid in this game, and there are two groups — the Yellow Triangles and the Blue Squares. The game assumes that you prefer to have at least 1/3rd of your neighbors being in the same group as you — something which seems relatively reasonable.

The game starts with a random distribution of Yellow Triangles and Blue Squares. The characters are agitated unless at least 1 of the three neighboring shapes closest to them are of the same group. Your job is to move them around until all of the characters are no longer agitated. Try the game out here.

The below is the random state of the beginning of the game. The characters with shocked faces are agitated, and need to be moved around.

You move, and you move again, and all of a sudden, your city looks like this:

That’s far more discriminated & separated than before! This is precisely how enclaves are born.

Ok, so what if people live around people of the same group as them? I have two responses to this.

Firstly, that undermines the solidarity of civic societies. For individuals in countries to feel part of a broader national project, there has to be intermixing. This is precisely the point Michael Sandel makes in Justice: What’s the right thing to do?. `

Secondly, such living patterns creates opportunities for structural discrimination. What is structural discrimination? This topic first requires some myth busting. It is NOT the same as what we think of as racism, sexism or all the other -isms — it doesn’t have to be tasted-based. In fact, it can happen due to innocent reasons. This is what makes structural discrimination dangerous.

For example, when the Interstate Highway System was built in the US, many highways were built right smack in the middle of marginalized communities because land prices were lower there. The decision to build a highway right in the middle of such communities further lowered land prices due to the externalities of having a highway there (e.g. noise & air pollution). Since land is a store of wealth for many families, this harmed generations of already lower-income, marginalized communities.

How do we prevent this? I would argue that Singapore’s Ethnic Integration Policy offers an interesting approach.

**Singapore’s EIP**

80% of Singaporeans live in public housing, called HDB flats. These HDB flats are socially engineered to promote racial integration — the racial proportions living in each flat generally reflect that of broader societies. When you apply to buy a HDB flat, you aren’t guaranteed to get the flat just by forking out enough money — these quotas are kept in mind.

What is the consequence? Singaporeans consistently rub shoulders with people of different ethnic groups. By consequence of living in the same area, children of different groups go to similar schools, making schools another avenue of social mixing. These interactions facilitate stronger bonds amongst Singaporeans.

Can the EIP make everything perfect? Likely not. Just living next to one another doesn’t mean you’d necessarily befriend your neighbors or even talk to one another. In fact, Singapore has seen neighborly conflicts take on a racial character on a few occasions.

Even if not perfect, I believe the EIP avoids the worse scenario of little inter-mixing between ethnicities. In that sense, it is a good example of using social engineering to build a civic society.

**Seeing the EIP through a different lens**

Before having tried my hand at the simulation, I didn’t realize how easy it is for enclaves to form. My study of economics revealed the significant harms that arise when enclaves exist. Through this, I realized how important the EIP is as a policy.

My next question is: is there a way to maximize the benefits of the EIP by encouraging the spirit of neighborly interactions, such that living amongst people of different cultures & ethnicities is not just tokenistic? That’s something for me to think about. My guess is that this must organically evolve, possible through civil society, not from government.
